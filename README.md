# Overview

Beantextures does two things: **generate image switching shader node group(s)** and then **expose the image index property in pose mode**â€”no more than that. You still get to set up your rig the way you want it to be!

Here's an example of a practical usage: ([you can get the model here](assets/been-model.zip))

# Why Beantextures?

Well, it automates the actual switch node generation, with the best^[most flexible but not that performant; shouldn't be too much of an issue for most rig setups.] approach to 2D image-switching animation (mix nodes)!

At least that's it for the node group generator. But whether the node properties controller makes your life simpler or not is totally subjective; at least it does for me. The Bean rig setup I made previously was done in just 2 days; it may take longer if I have to rely solely on drivers (the common approach).

<img src="assets/generation-panel.png">

- Supports 4 image indexing types: standard **single integers**, **ranged integers**, **ranged floats**, and most importantly, **enums!** (a.k.a dropdown items)
- Output alpha channel of the active image
- Specify a fallback image when the index doesn't correspond to any image texture
